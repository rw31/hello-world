# hello-world
Just another repository

Trying to modify this hello-world file and see how the change works.

Trying to write some sentences, hope this one is fine.

The moon goes around the earth each day; or does the earth goes around the moon? depends on who you ask, isn't it?
The sun goes around the earth each day; or does the earth goes around the sun? depends on who you ask, isn't it?

Ok enough of crap; let's close this file.
